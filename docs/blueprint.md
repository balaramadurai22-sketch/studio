# **App Name**: Mistral Next

## Core Features:

- Landing Page: Serves as the introduction and first impression of the platform. The design is clean, minimal, and professional, with a full-width hero section that immediately explains the product’s value proposition. A bold headline conveys the purpose of the AI assistant — whether it’s for productivity, coding help, research, or business support — followed by a short subtext that explains how it can transform the user’s workflow. The hero section features a prominent call-to-action button such as “Start Chatting” or “Launch Now,” ensuring the user knows exactly how to get started. Alongside the text, an animated mockup of the chat interface gives visitors a preview of what they can expect inside, building trust and curiosity.
- Features Section: Showcases the platform’s capabilities with large, readable sections: natural language understanding for conversations, multimodal support for images and files, code assistance with real-time execution, and personalized memory for context-aware interactions. Each feature is described in detail with icons or subtle illustrations that reinforce the idea without overloading the page. A testimonials or use-case section highlights how individuals and teams use the assistant — whether for coding, research, business ideation, or everyday productivity.
- Onboarding Pathway: New users can begin a session instantly without mandatory sign-up, but advanced features like project saving, history, and personalized settings are gated behind account creation. A lightweight footer contains essential links such as About, Pricing, Documentation, Contact, and Terms of Service. This design ensures the landing page is more than just an introduction: it’s a conversion-focused entry point that smoothly directs the user into the core experience — the chat.
- Chat Page: The interface transitions to the chat page, which forms the backbone of the application. The chat environment is divided into two major areas: the sidebar for navigation and workspace management, and the main chat window for the actual conversation.
- Sidebar: Positioned on the left, acts as the command center. At the very top, the platform’s logo and a toggle button allow for expansion or collapse of the menu, ensuring flexibility between compact and detailed views. Just below, a universal search field lets users find conversations, projects, or AI agents across their account. The navigation area is neatly segmented into categories: a “Chats” section displaying recent and pinned conversations, an “Agents” section offering specialized AI modes like Writer, Coder, or Researcher, a “Tools” section listing available plugins or integrations such as web browsing or file analysis, and a “Projects” section where users can group conversations into dedicated workspaces. At the bottom sits the profile section, where the user’s avatar, settings menu, and logout option reside.
- Main Chat Window: Dominates the center of the screen and is carefully designed to balance usability with sophistication. At the very top, a header bar shows the chat title or project name, accompanied by a dropdown that gives options to rename, duplicate, or export the conversation. Quick-access icons allow users to save the conversation to a project, export it in various formats like PDF or Markdown, or clear the dialogue to begin fresh.
- Multimodal Chat Interface: Design a minimalist and intuitive chat interface with support for text, images, code blocks, and file uploads. Uses typing indicators.
- Conversation Feed: Messages appear as structured dialogue. User messages are aligned to the right with a clean, muted background, while AI responses are aligned left, highlighted with an avatar or branding element. Responses are not limited to plain text — the system supports markdown formatting, images, tables, charts, and expandable code blocks with syntax highlighting. For programming queries, the interface automatically splits the output into two synchronized panes: one containing the explanation or reasoning in prose, and the other showing the raw executable code, complete with copy-to-clipboard buttons. Each message is interactive, allowing users to copy, share, pin, regenerate, or provide feedback with a single click.
- Input Area: The input box is large, resizable, and designed to encourage long-form prompting while remaining minimalistic. Next to the input are utility buttons for uploading files or images, enabling voice dictation, or accessing quick settings. The send button is clearly distinguished, while keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line) make typing natural. Above the input, dynamic prompt suggestions appear contextually, such as “summarize,” “explain simply,” or “show code example,” nudging users toward faster interactions without needing to type full commands.
- Optional Utility Panel: An optional utility panel can slide open for additional context. This panel includes an outline of the current conversation, memory-based context notes that the assistant retains between sessions, and links to related documents or APIs the user has attached. This panel is particularly useful for professional workflows, acting as a persistent side-reference library while keeping the main conversation uncluttered.
- Floating Utilities: Supporting these primary components are floating utilities like a feedback button for quick rating of responses, a toggle for light/dark mode to suit user preference, and a compact help menu with a shortcut guide.
- Responsiveness: The entire system is engineered to be fully responsive. On desktop screens, the sidebar, chat, and utility panel can coexist comfortably. On tablets, the sidebar reduces to icons, and the utility panel hides by default, focusing on the chat. On mobile devices, the chat takes over the entire screen, the input remains docked at the bottom, and the sidebar transforms into a slide-in overlay accessible via a hamburger menu.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#673AB7) for a modern, intellectual feel.
- Background color: Light violet (#F3E5F5) for a subtle, sophisticated backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) to provide a high contrast call to action element.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a techy, modern look. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and readable text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets clearly.
- Use minimalist icons to represent tools and actions in the chat interface.
- Incorporate subtle animations for loading states, message transitions, and user interactions.
